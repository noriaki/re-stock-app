# LINE Mini App / LIFF Integration for Re-Stock App

## Implementation Summary

We implemented LINE Frontend Framework (LIFF) integration into the Re-Stock app to enable LINE Mini App functionality. This allows users to access the inventory management app directly within the LINE messenger platform.

### Completed Work

1. **LIFF SDK Integration**
   - Added LIFF JavaScript SDK to the project
   - Implemented initialization in a client-side Next.js component
   - Created typings for the LIFF SDK methods

2. **Authentication Components**
   - Implemented user authentication with LINE Login
   - Created components to handle login/logout functionality
   - Added user profile display with LINE profile information

3. **LINE Features**
   - Added LINE sharing functionality for low-stock items
   - Implemented LINE notification capabilities
   - Added LINE-specific UI components that follow LINE design guidelines

4. **Environment Configuration**
   - Set up environment variables for LIFF ID and other configuration
   - Implemented configuration validation

### Technical Implementation Details

#### LIFF SDK Setup
- Added LIFF SDK script loading with dynamic import
- Created initialization function with error handling
- Implemented proper Next.js client component architecture

#### Authentication Flow
- Implemented authentication state management with Zustand
- Created adapters for LINE profile data storage
- Handled LINE login redirects and state preservation

#### Project Structure Changes
- Added LINE-specific components in `/components/features/line`
- Created utility functions in `/lib/line`
- Added new state management for LINE user information

### Current Status

#### Working Features
- LIFF initialization and basic configuration
- LINE Login integration
- User profile access

#### Issues and Challenges
- 404 errors during LIFF URL redirection testing
- Environment variable configuration needs refinement
- Complete testing of sharing functionality is pending
- Server-side component requirements need clarification

### Next Steps

1. **Complete Debugging**
   - Resolve the 404 error issues with LIFF URL
   - Test authentication flow in actual LINE environment

2. **Add Server-Side Components**
   - Implement necessary server-side components for full functionality
   - Set up proper environment variable handling

3. **Enhance Features**
   - Improve LINE sharing with rich message format
   - Implement LINE notification for low stock items
   - Add deep linking capabilities

4. **Testing**
   - Perform comprehensive testing in LINE environment
   - Verify proper functioning across devices

5. **Documentation**
   - Document the LINE Mini App setup process
   - Add user guide for LINE-specific features

## Technical Notes

- LINE LIFF SDK version: 2.23.0
- LIFF requires specific URL structure with LIFF ID
- Authentication flow requires careful state management
- Environment configuration must be properly set up in LINE Developer Console
- Need to handle browser compatibility issues in LINE browser environment
